  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions <img class="floatright" src="http://www.vesperix.com/Vesperix-small-72.png" alt="Vesperix Logo"></h2>
  <div class="mtb">

  <p><em>Q1. Is ARM support included in the latest stable (3.10) release of ATLAS?</em></p>
  <p>A1. Yes. We have contributed the ARM architecture detection code and the NEON assembly GEMM routine to the development branch,
     Clint Whaley (the main author of ATLAS) has written VFP assembly GEMM routines, and his students have contrbuted additional 
     level 2 BLAS. ATLAS 3.10.0 includes architecture defaults for a Cortex A9 with the soft floating-point ABI (like Angstrom-based
     distributions and Ubuntu prior to 12.04). If you have a distribution using the hard floating-point ABI (like Ubuntu 12.04 or
     later), you can buld ATLAS 3.10.0 using</p>
  <p><tt>../configure -D c -DATL_ARM_HARDFP=1 -Si archdef 0 -Fa alg -mfloat-abi=hard</tt></p>
  <p>Note that mainline ATLAS releases like 3.10 have always ignored any floating point unit that does not conform to the IEEE 754 
     specification, so what you'll get if you do this is a BLAS library using the IEEE compliant VFP. If you need the somewhat higher
     single precision speed of NEON, you'll need to specifically tell ATLAS to use non-IEEE compliant routines, by using</p>
  <p><tt>../configure -D c -DATL_NONIEEE=1 -Si archdef 0</tt></p>
  for the soft floating-point ABI, and
  <p><tt>../configure -D c -DATL_NONIEEE=1 -D c -DATL_ARM_HARDFP=1 -Si archdef 0 -Fa alg -mfloat-abi=hard</tt></p>
  if your distribution has a hard floating-point ABI.
  <p><em>Q2. What if I have a Cortex A9 processor without NEON, like the Tegra 2?</em></p>
  <p>A2. When ATLAS tries GEMM routines, it ignores those that fail on a given platform. On any ARM without NEON, obviously the NEON GEMM will fail, 
     but Clint Whaley's VFP assembly GEMM routines should be tried and work. You'll get the same double precision results (since those use VFP in all
     cases), and peak single precision results on a Cortex A9 are about 1.2 gigaflops on a single processor (versus 1.5 gigaflops with NEON).</p>

  <p><em>Q3. Can I cross compile ATLAS?</em></p>
  <p>A3. No, and it wouldn't be a good idea even if you could. ATLAS chooses the fastest routines for inclusion in the BLAS library on 
     the basis of tests it makes as the library builds. If you're not building the library on a machine similar to the one you want to 
     use the BLAS on, then all that tuning is meaningless.</p>

  <p><em>Q4. How can I get ATLAS to run on Android if I can't cross compile? Android doesn't support native compilation.</em></p>
  <p>A4. The best solution we can offer is to compile ATLAS under Linux on the closest possible analog of the target system, and use the resulting
     library with the NDK. If the target system is running a Cortex A9, a Pandaboard would make a good analog, for example. We're not aware of any 
     widely available Linux systems running Qualcomm processors that would let you target those Android platforms; if you know of any, please tell 
     us so we can mention them here.</p>

  <p><em>Q5. Ubuntu 12.04 has CPU throttling, and ATLAS <tt>configure</tt> complains about this, but the generic ATLAS instructions for turning off 
     throttling don't work on ARM.  How do I turn throttling off?.</em></p>
  <p>A5. First, check in <tt>/sys/devices/system/cpu</tt> to see how many cores you have (you'll see directories named <tt>cpu0</tt>, <tt>cpu1</tt>, etc.). 
     Then run the following commands for each of the cores (we're showing <tt>cpu0</tt> here, but you need to do this for all of them):</p>
  <dl>
  <dd><tt>cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq</tt></dd>
  <dd><tt>sudo sh -c "echo performance > scaling_governor"</tt></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>You'll need sudoer (administrator) access to do this, of course.</p>

  <p><em>Q6. Making ATLAS with <tt>gcc</tt> 4.6.1 sometimes fails during mvtune with the error message <tt>VARIATION EXCEEDS TOLERENCE, RERUN WITH HIGHER REPS</tt>. 
     How do I fix this?</em></p>
  <p>A6. This is an issue with ATLAS' timings that can normally be worked around by simply running <tt>make</tt> again (sometimes more than once). As long as <tt>make</tt> 
     stops at a different point in the build each time, continue to retry. There is a full 
     <a href=http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata3.8.4.html#tol>discussion</a> of this issue and workaround in the ATLAS errata. If rerunning <tt>make</tt> as many times 
     as necessary doesn't fix the problem, please <a href="mailto:atlas-arm@vesperix.com">let us know</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Q7. I need fast single precision, but I also need IEEE 754 compliance, which NEON doesn't have. What do I do?</em></p>
  <p>A7. With a couple of quick edits, you can tell ATLAS not to use the NEON GEMM routines, which are not fully IEEE 754 compliant, but still use the
     single precison VFP assembly routines, which are. From your base directory, go to <tt>tune/blas/gemm/CASES</tt>, and edit the files <tt>scases.flg</tt> and
     <tt>ccases.flg</tt>. At the top of each file, you'll see a number, which tells ATLAS how many routines there are in the file to try. The NEON routine is the
     last one listed in both files, so decreasing the number by one will tell ATLAS to skip the NEON routine, but still try the VFP assembly routines. Then,
     create a new build directory, <tt>cd</tt> into it, and rerun <tt>configure -Si archdef 0</tt> and <tt>make</tt> (not forgetting to follow up with <tt>make check</tt> 
     and Antoine's tester). This should give around 70-75% of the peak performance of NEON on a Cortex A9, with full IEEE 754 compliance.</p>
