  <div class="mtb">
  <p><em>Versions 3.3.4 and later of the mainline FFTW distribution include support for ARM NEON, and have all the functionality of
     our FFTW-ARM release except the cycle counters. The ARM support was developed by the original authors of FFTW, and the latest version
     is available from the <a href="http://www.fftw.org/download.html">FFTW download page</a>.</em></p>
  <p><em>We strongly recommend that all users transition to the
     mainline release.</em></p>
  <p>Although their version was developed independently, the implementation is very similar (because there are only a 
     few ways to code the FFTW primitives in NEON). Because of this, we expect that there will be very little difference in speed 
     between their implementation and ours.</p>
  <p>We will continue to make FFTW-ARM available here for stubborn users, but we are no longer maintaining, bug fixing, or supporting FFTW-ARM.</p>
