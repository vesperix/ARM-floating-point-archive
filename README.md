# Archive of obsolete ARM floating point software

This is an archive of the ARM ports of FFTW and ATLAS, developed by Vesperix in 2011-2014 and now obsolete.

The mainline releases, at the links below, now support ARM and will give you equal or better performance,
along with the bug fixes that come with an actively maintained distribution.

>[ATLAS 3.10](http://sourceforge.net/projects/math-atlas/files/Stable) is a stable release of the mainline
> ATLAS distribution with ARM support. We contributed the NEON matrix multiplication routines from our
>version 3.8.4 ARM, and additional improvements and level-2 routines were added by ATLAS lead author
>Clint Whaley and his students.

>[FFTW 3.3](http://www.fftw.org/download.html) includes NEON support written by the original developers of FFTW.
>Performance is very similar to our NEON implementation.
